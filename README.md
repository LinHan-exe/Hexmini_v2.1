Hexmini_v2.1: ADX EMA Trend Detector

This code was written in Pinescript, the language used for Indicators on Trading View. 

The indicator uses ADX (Average Directional Index) and EMA's (Exponential Moving Averages) to provide a better understanding of price action to traders.
Based on the strength of a trend and position of the EMA's, the user can see a gradient of colors on the backgrounds of each candle. 
Green tinted backgrounds indicate a bullish trend, whilst Red tinted backgrounds indicate a bearish trend. 
The more Green/Red the background is, the stronger a trend is. Weaker trends will appear yellow/orange. 
There are over 100 unique shades of color in the gradient from Green to Red on the graph based on trend strength.
Trend strength changes based on ADX are also displayed in the top right corner. 

This indicator is best used on the 5 minute candlestick chart.

Default Settings:
ADX Length: 5
EMA Short Length: 2
EMA Long Length: 5

As this is an indicator and not a strategy, it will not display entries and exits.
This indicator is best used to confirm a move. It is more reactionary than predictive.
